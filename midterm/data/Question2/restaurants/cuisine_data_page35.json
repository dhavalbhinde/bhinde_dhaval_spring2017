Those oversized soup bowls were piled high with pasta, most of it delivering blunt, big-shouldered flavors. This cozy 44-seat spot, which opened in December at 106 Woodbury Road (516-932-9788), is owned by Philip Morizio, the chef and part owner of Al Dente of Oyster Bay, where prices are slightly higher. At the Hicksville site, a bowl of pasta with a rambunctious marinara sauce, accompanied by an exceptional house salad, cost $10.95 and a sloppy, runny, but tasty, thin-crusted, classica pizza, loaded with lots of cheese and tomato sauce, went for $5.50. The peppy, already popular little Cafe Al Dente, with its bare tables, terra cotta floor, pressed-tin ceiling, fabric booths, faux brick wall and Italian family pictures, appeals to eaters, not diners, to people interested in value and taste, not prestige and status. It offers warm garlic and (commercial bakery) onion bread in baskets, glasses of complimentary wine on tables, a takeout following that rivals its sit-down clientele and the sound of popular classics sung by Tony Bennett, Frank Sinatra, Johnny Mathis and Johnny Ray.", "subsection_name": null, "snippet": "NO wonder this place is busy,'' blurted out a first-time visitor at the new Cafe Al Dente in Hicksville after looking at the menu's modest prices and then glancing at an adjacent table and seeing four jumbo bowls of pasta virtually crowding everyt..."}, {"blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Opinion", "word_count": 168, "headline": {"main": "French Cuisine Isn't Home Grown"}, "multimedia": [], "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "print_page": "24", "slideshow_credits": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "KOPLAN, STEVEN"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "GREAT BRITAIN"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "FRANCE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESTAURANTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}], "pub_date": "1998-05-14T00:00:00Z", "_id": "4fd1deae8eb7c8105d723008", "type_of_material": "Letter", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/14/opinion/l-french-cuisine-isn-t-home-grown-946354.html", "news_desk": "Editorial Desk", "abstract": "Letter from Culinary Institute of America professor Steven Koplan disputes May 9 Arts & Ideas article on development of French and English cuisine; says it wrongly implied that London only recently became most exciting restaurant city in Europe (S)", "lead_paragraph": "To the Editor: Your May 9 Arts & Ideas article on the development of French and English cuisine implies that London has only recently become the most exciting restaurant city in Europe.", "subsection_name": null, "snippet": "To the Editor:    Your May 9 Arts & Ideas article on the development of French and English cuisine implies that London has only recently become the most exciting restaurant city in Europe...."}, {"blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Dining and Wine; Style", "word_count": 2073, "headline": {"main": "Vietnam's Cuisine: Echoes of Empire"}, "multimedia": [], "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Molly", "lastname": "O'NEILL"}], "original": "By MOLLY O'NEILL"}, "document_type": "article", "print_page": "1", "slideshow_credits": null, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "HUE (VIETNAM)"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "VIETNAM"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECIPES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FOOD"}], "pub_date": "1998-04-15T00:00:00Z", "_id": "4fd1ea028eb7c8105d739404", "type_of_material": "News", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/15/dining/vietnam-s-cuisine-echoes-of-empire.html", "news_desk": "Dining In, Dining Out/Style Desk", "abstract": "Molly O'Neill reports on cuisine of Vietnam; describes scene in Hue, once Vietnam's imperial city and long the epicenter of country's classic cuisine; photos; recipes (M)", "lead_paragraph": "MOST of Vietnam is bathed by a constant gold sun that blesses the land with rich rice paddies and fields ripe with vegetables and fruit.

These days, however, it is difficult to attach a rating to this place, which, on one hand, can prepare a gorgeous dish of grouper without fault and, on the other, serve inedibly burned and desiccated scampi.
