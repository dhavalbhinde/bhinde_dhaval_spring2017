It all derives from the Chinese passion for food, of course. Not even the French and Italians are such natural-bred, analytic, argumentative food critics as the Chinese. And seeing a group of Chinese in a restaurant makes one wonder whether the Chinese ideogram for happiness, which pictures various less appropriate things, ought not rather show a large family at dinner. Whatever the reasons for the bounty, southern Westchester has picked up its chopsticks and enjoyed it. Now Szechuan House, an offshoot of Scarsdale's long-established Szechuan Flower, has opened in an Elmsford shopping center, and we seem to have yet another fairly dependable source for the spicy, complex dishes of Sichuan Province.", "subsection_name": null, "snippet": "IN the last year, more than a half-dozen Chinese restaurants have opened in southern Westchester, and every one has been commendable in one way or another.

heading for Munich should erase from their minds every cliche about German food: the dark beer halls reeking of stale beer, oversized platters of sauerbraten drowning in gravy, floury dumplings that

Modern Munich is another world altogether. At every level -- in elegant Old World dining rooms as well as popular beer halls -- the cuisine is more varied and balanced than one would suppose. The current generation of chefs is among the best Europe has to offer. Bright, enthusiastic and hard-working, they are also not afraid to embrace their own heritage, with inventive twists on dumplings, sausages, cabbage and sauerkraut. And language is rarely a problem here: Almost everyone speaks English, and if menus are not already translated, waiters and sommeliers will eagerly assist. Le Gourmet Otto Koch, a chef who has a virtual empire that includes Le Gourmet, which has one Michelin star, and the more casual Restaurant Schwarzwalder, just downstairs, combines German know-how with a solid knowledge of French technique, resulting in a cuisine that is pure, honest and full of earthy, unmasked flavors.", "subsection_name": null, "snippet": "TRAVELERS heading for Munich should erase from their minds every cliche about German food: the dark beer halls reeking of stale beer, oversized platters of sauerbraten drowning in gravy, floury dumplings that could double as lead sinkers.
