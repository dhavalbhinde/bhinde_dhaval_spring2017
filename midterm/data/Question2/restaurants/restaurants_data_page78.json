Even casual diners can assume Le Bernardin is French, or Mesa Grill Southwestern. They may not be so sure about a restaurant called Babbo or Town, but once they enter the dining room and examine the menu, they are on solid ground. Not so with Pazo. At this small, refined restaurant, which opened in midsummer on East 57th Street, identity seems playfully concealed in layers of ambiguity. The bill-of-fare begins with an explanation that clouds rather than clarifies: ''an American menu infused with the flavors and ingredients of the Mediterranean.''", "subsection_name": null, "snippet": "LIKE the movies, the restaurant business thrives on the high concept.

It only seems that way. But 24 years is a very long time, the equivalent of a century or more in restaurant years. The astonishing thing is not how long the River Caf\u00e9 has been in business but how good it has been for most of those two-and-half decades, and how many star chefs it has produced. It has been the jumping-off point for David Burke, Larry Forgione, Charlie Palmer and most recently, Rick Laakkonen, who left the River Caf\u00e9 to make a big splash at Ilo last year. That is an impressive list of alumni, even more so for a restaurant catering to tourists and couples seeking a romantic evening. A view and a setting like the River Caf\u00e9's should be death to serious food. But it isn't. Brad Steelman, who took over as executive chef about a year and a half ago, holds up his end. That is saying a lot, because the built-in limitations at the River Caf\u00e9 are daunting. Most diners come to gaze at the twinkling lights of Lower Manhattan, celebrate a promotion or impress a date. The River Caf\u00e9 is a special-occasion restaurant, Tavern on the Green with a river attached, and its patrons, many of them out-of-towners who might not be eager to experience shaved bottarga, do not book a table in search of culinary adventure. The kitchen aims to please but not to shock, and Mr. Steelman, whose long r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes stints at Montrachet, the Water Club and Tribeca Grill, shows a gift for making fairly simple food seem a lot more elegant than it really is. He sneaks in excitement by the side door, with small flourishes that enliven mandatory entrees like duck breast, loin of lamb, sirloin steak and red snapper.", "subsection_name": null, "snippet": "THE River Caf\u00e9 has not had a run as long as that of the ''The Fantasticks.''
