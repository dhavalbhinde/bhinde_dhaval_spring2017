The inevitable result of such action is poor food and rude or careless service, and a spate of justified complaints. It is gratifying, therefore, to discover that Vienna '79, which received a three-star rating last March, not only has been able to cope with success, but also has improved to the point where it well deserves a four-star rating. This despite the fact that the original chef left early in the fall to be replaced by the former sous-chef, Thomas Ferlesch, who is 24 years old. Full credit for this success belongs to Peter Grunauer, the proprietor, a dedicated cook and student of cuisine. Were he not, a change of chefs could turn this into a brand new restaurant. But Mr. Grunauer's consistent standards and knowledge of the cuisine has bridged the gap between staff changes, and his almost constant presence has kept cooks and waiters working smoothly and professionally.", "subsection_name": null, "snippet": "ALTHOUGH it seems quite natural that a negative review can damage a restaurant, it may be surprising to learn that a rave sometimes does a kind of damage all its own.
