This Far Eastern cuisine incorporates into its own culinary tradition the curries of India and the Chinese knack of contrasting and balancing texture and flavor and of cooking foods quickly. The flavors that give Thai food its distinctive edge come from such ingredients as fragrant coriander, lime, lemon grass, a range of chilies and nam pla (a fermented fish sauce), used alone or teamed with neuturalizing peanut sauce, coconut milk or cucumber. Whatever combination, the result adds up to a cuisine deliciously complex and engaging. Thai cuisine has been slow in finding its way to the county, but now Reka's, newly opened in a small, unassuming block of shops just an arm's length away from busy Route 6, brings a respectable representation of the tastes of Siam. Thai objects decorate the showcase entrance and include a low dining table, cushions, a gilded cart, tusks, carvings and books. Beyond, the dining room walls reveal only a trace of their pizza parlor past under a lamina of Thai decorations.
