What makes them memorable is a technique Lett calls for during the cooking: tossing the tubers in honey before roasting them, which intensifies their caramelizing. The crisp, near-burned sweetness works beautifully against the heat of the pepper and the acidic creaminess of the yogurt you dab onto the dish at the end.

It takes nerve to unleash a chef like Stanley Wong, whose idiosyncratic interpretation of Southeast Asian cuisine walks a fine line between provocation and insolence. Finally, as a purely commercial venture, TanDa represents a bold gamble for its owners, who landed a coup with the painfully fashionable Moomba but have decided, this time around, to make an impression with serious, adventurous food. TanDa, named after a 20th-century Vietnamese poet, does make an impression. New York has seen its share of Asian fusion cooking, but Mr. Wong, who has an unusual r\u00e9sum\u00e9, strikes out for new territory, foraging far and wide for ingredients and employing them in unusual ways. Prickly ash berry jus, to cite one example, stumped me momentarily. It appears with a sizable New York strip steak with a peppery crust, and therein lies the solution to this minor mystery. Prickly ash is the tree better known for its dried fruit, Sichuan pepper, and Mr. Wong's scorching steak surprise turns out to be a scorching Asian steak au poivre.", "subsection_name": null, "snippet": "VIETNAMESE may or may not have a word for chutzpah, but TanDa has plenty of it, regardless.
