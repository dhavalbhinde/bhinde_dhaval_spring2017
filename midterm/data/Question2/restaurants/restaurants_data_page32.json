Thierry Kl\u00e9m\u00e9niuk, hoping to repeat the formula in Manhattan, has the star-power backing of investors like Johnny Depp, Sean Penn, John Malkovich and Harvey Weinstein. The artfully decadent retro Asian d\u00e9cor, the waitresses in slinky silk mandarin dresses -- it all spells the kind of restaurant where mere mortals feel worthless, and the food does not even pretend to be anything more than a fashion accessory. Man Ray is not like that, though. It's dangerous even to imply such a thing, but I think it actually wants to be liked. The welcome at the door is warm. The servers, in contrast to the layered hipness of the d\u00e9cor, talk like ordinary people and seem eager to please. It's certainly true that anyone carrying an extra five pounds will not want to spend time at the little tables up front, or the long bar that faces them, where youth and beauty find each other. That's fine. Somewhere along the line, Man Ray decided that a restaurant does not have to sneer to be stylish.

Danz\u00f3n, named after the Cuban ballroom-dance style popular in Veracruz, is obviously a labor of love. Ms. Mart\u00ednez has taken over a shabby, narrow two-story building in modest surroundings, just around the corner from Kalustyan's and Curry in a Hurry, and turned it into a high-energy, brightly colored folk shrine, with peach-colored walls and rusticated wooden shelves containing dancing shoes and carved wooden figures.", "subsection_name": null, "snippet": "VERACRUZ, a long, narrow strip of land that runs along the Gulf of Mexico, is home to one of Mexico's most complicated melting-pot cuisines.

Marcus Samuelsson, Aquavit's restlessly inventive executive chef, is not the formula type. He's more likely to wander off into strange territory, and that's exactly what he seemed to be doing when I ate at Aquavit early this year, soon after he had revised his menu.

The defining moment, as they say, came midway through an epic-length flatbread sandwich, a footlong open-face affair with more stops on it than the E line. It featured lamb, large savory chunks of it, but also included a roasted red pepper salad, rouille, cucumber raita and a large mound of whipped hummus. It was not so much a sandwich as a buffet, and it wore me out. On the other hand, like many of Mr. English's creations, it was fail-safe. If you did not care for the red pepper salad, you could move on to the next thing, or the thing after that.
