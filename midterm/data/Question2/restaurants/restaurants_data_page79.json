But I defy anyone to summon up a mental picture of 41st Street between Madison and Park Avenues. Better yet, thanks to several double crosses perpetrated by the one-way traffic system, I'm sure I could get rich betting motorists that they can't get there on the first try. The reason to take the trouble is Virot, a new restaurant in the equally new Dylan Hotel. Didier Virot, formerly the executive chef at JoJo and sous-chef at Jean Georges, has set up shop in what once was the ballroom of the Chemists Club, a doubly perplexing spot. Who knew that chemists had a club, or that they gave balls? It's a quirky place for a restaurant, but Mr. Virot may be just the chef for it. He's inventive, with an antic streak. He takes risks. Some of them don't pay off. But diners will not leave Virot feeling that they've had an ordinary meal.", "subsection_name": null, "snippet": "IT'S not easy to hide a restaurant smack-dab in the middle of Midtown.

He intended to take the direct route, moving from Bouley, where he served as sous chef for five years, to the post of executive chef at Danube, David Bouley's ambitious, bejeweled shrine to the cooking of Austria-Hungary. When the project stalled, however, Mr. Gutenbrunner became restless and left. He took over the kitchen at Monkey Bar, putting a Viennese spin on the menu that never felt quite right, given the restaurant's roots in the New York of the 1930's and 40's. Now he has found a new setting in Wallse, a corner restaurant in the far West Village that he has turned into a modest showcase for the Austrian cooking he grew up with. The Bouley-Gutenbrunner split works out very nicely for New York diners, who can now take their Austria deluxe, or in the relaxed, homey version offered at Wallse. (The name comes from Wallsee, Mr. Gutenbrunner's hometown, with a Frenchified spelling to make it easier to pronounce: it's VAHL-zay.) The decor is chaste, with white walls, black banquettes and black chairs that have just the hint of an Art Nouveau wiggle in their design and a jolt of unexpected color on their neon-yellow and red seats.
