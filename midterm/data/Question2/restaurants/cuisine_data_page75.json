Fall is also harvest time in northern New Mexico. It may seem improbable that much grows in a desert area beyond tumbleweeds and pinon trees, but the Rio Grande supports an ancient network of farms that supply Santa Fe with fresh produce. Visit the city's farmers' market on a Saturday morning and, with the piquant aroma of roasting chilies in the air, you'll see a gorgeous cornucopia of fruits and vegetables, including many heirloom varieties.

Fresh coriander can be added to spicy meatballs, made into a paste with ginger, garlic and chilis and put in curries, or used to flavor beef stews and lamb kebabs. I like to mix it with cumin and lime juice and serve it with roast chicken, or add it to scallop seviche, made with limes, raw onions and chilis.

The restaurant, in a house, is white stucco with dogwood used for wainscoting, booths, ceiling beams, ornamental railings and the bar. What isn't dark wood is dark brown leatherette. That includes the tablecloths, a singular off note in a decorating scheme that is clubby and handsomely attractive.
