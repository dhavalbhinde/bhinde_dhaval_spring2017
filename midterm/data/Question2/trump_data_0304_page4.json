Tears rolling down their cheeks, they couldn't stop laughing or keep their contagion of chuckles from spreading to almost half the other girls at their boarding school. Some fits were lasting minutes, others hours, some up to 16 days, until exasperated administrators closed the school five months later. Afflicted girls were sent home to their villages around Lake Victoria, where they duly infected more children and young adults with their ''sickness.'' Before the epidemic finally relented, in 1964, it forced the temporary closing of more than 14 schools, all because of unstoppable laughter. What was so funny no one ever discovered, but the mirth gathered a momentum that caught hundreds of unsuspecting villagers in its riptide. At the time, it was considered a pathology to be quarantined and quashed. But today, this unmoored laughter is celebrated in over 1,000 laughter clubs worldwide as a therapy to reduce stress, lower blood pressure, strengthen the immune system and perhaps even lead to world peace.", "type_of_material": "News", "byline": {"person": [{"firstname": "Eric", "organization": "", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "lastname": "TRUMP"}], "original": "By ERIC TRUMP"}, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/27/arts/got-the-giggles-join-the-club.html", "news_desk": "Arts & Ideas/Cultural Desk"}, {"subsection_name": null, "source": "The New York Times", "document_type": "article", "_id": "5359663c38f0d824f95e76d0", "abstract": "Eric Trump Modern Love column describes how his romantic relationship with his professor dissolved after undergoing a successful kidney transplant; says that his illness served as third partner in their relationship and, once that was gone, so was their connection.", "blog": [], "snippet": "Her curiosity was piqued; she became a voyeur, wanting to know where the scar would be....", "print_page": "6", "section_name": "Fashion & Style", "slideshow_credits": null, "keywords": [{"value": "Kidneys", "rank": "1", "is_major": "N", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Transplants", "rank": "2", "is_major": "N", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Modern Love (Times Column)", "rank": "3", "is_major": "Y", "name": "subject"}], "word_count": "1490", "pub_date": "2014-04-27T00:00:00Z", "headline": {"print_headline": "My Illness, the Third Partner in Our Relationship", "kicker": "Modern Love", "main": "My Illness, the Third Partner in Our Relationship", "content_kicker": "Modern Love"}, "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2014/04/27/fashion/27MODERNLOVE/27MODERNLOVE-thumbWide.jpg", "subtype": "wide", "height": 126, "width": 190, "type": "image", "legacy": {"wide": "images/2014/04/27/fashion/27MODERNLOVE/27MODERNLOVE-thumbWide.jpg", "widewidth": "190", "wideheight": "126"}}, {"url": "images/2014/04/27/fashion/27MODERNLOVE/27MODERNLOVE-articleLarge.jpg", "subtype": "xlarge", "height": 383, "width": 600, "type": "image", "legacy": {"xlargeheight": "383", "xlargewidth": "600", "xlarge": "images/2014/04/27/fashion/27MODERNLOVE/27MODERNLOVE-articleLarge.jpg"}}, {"url": "images/2014/04/27/fashion/27MODERNLOVE/27MODERNLOVE-thumbStandard.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "height": 75, "width": 75, "type": "image", "legacy": {"thumbnailwidth": "75", "thumbnailheight": "75", "thumbnail": "images/2014/04/27/fashion/27MODERNLOVE/27MODERNLOVE-thumbStandard.jpg"}}], "lead_paragraph": "Her curiosity was piqued; she became a voyeur, wanting to know where the scar would be.", "type_of_material": "News", "byline": {"contributor": "", "person": [{"firstname": "Eric", "organization": "", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "lastname": "TRUMP"}], "original": "By ERIC TRUMP"}, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/fashion/Modern-Love-My-Illness-the-Third-Partner-in-Our-Relationship.html", "news_desk": "Styles"}, {"subsection_name": null, "source": "The New York Times", "document_type": "article", "_id": "589a728095d0e0392607f22d", "abstract": null, "blog": [], "snippet": "A lawsuit filed by the first lady shatters any veneer of plausible deniability about the Trump family\u2019s transactional view of the presidency....", "print_page": "24", "section_name": "Opinion", "slideshow_credits": null, "keywords": [{"value": "Trump, Melania", "rank": "1", "is_major": "N", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "First Ladies (US)", "rank": "2", "is_major": "N", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Suits and Litigation (Civil)", "rank": "3", "is_major": "N", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Daily Mail", "rank": "4", "is_major": "N", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "Libel and Slander", "rank": "5", "is_major": "N", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Conflicts of Interest", "rank": "6", "is_major": "N", "name": "subject"}], "word_count": "369", "pub_date": "2017-02-08T01:20:57+0000", "headline": {"print_headline": "Melania Trump Inc.
