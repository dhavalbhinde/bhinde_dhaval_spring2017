''A great rennaissance is under way in Spanish cooking,'' said Inaki Oyarbide, chef at Principe de Viana, a popular Madrid restaurant and one of the pacesetters. ''It is part of the great social and cultural changes taking place all over Spain.'' The new Spanish cuisine includes dishes such as Mr. Oyarbide's baked hake sitting atop a pureed green bell pepper sauce, a modern version of a hake and sliced peppers preparation. Or there is oxtail with a sage-flavored sauce of pureed green beans, leeks, onions and swiss chard, all favorite Spanish ingredients but traditionally used in more stewlike dishes. Pedro Larumbe, the chef of Cabo Mayor in Madrid and winner of the 1985 Ministry of Culture prize as Spain's best chef, serves new-style specialties such as quail in a refined version of Spanish escabeche, a mixture of olive oil, wine vinegar, onions, thyme and toasted bay leaves more often used to marinate fish fillets.", "subsection_name": null, "snippet": "WHILE Americans are embracing traditional Spanish foods such as paella and gazpacho, Spaniards are increasingly turning to something else.

For green salads, the standard item was iceberg lettuce. There were exceptions: some decent and substantial seafood and poultry salads such as lobster, crab, shrimp and chicken. And there was the ubiquitous chef's salad with its combination of ham, cheese, chicken and hard-cooked eggs. But it was the arrival of nouvelle cuisine that rescued the salad. With its emphasis on light, colorful, imaginative ideas, nouvelle opened up a new array of possibilities. Sauteed goose liver on a bed of greens, dressed with walnut or hazelnut oil and raspberry vinegar, is just one example of how far a salad can go when its maker decides to pull out a few stops.", "subsection_name": null, "snippet": "THE salad has come a long way lately in this country.
