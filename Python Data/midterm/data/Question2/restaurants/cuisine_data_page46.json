The state's tourism bureau prefers the first moniker to promote the powdery white sands and the clear blue-green waters of the Gulf of Mexico between Pensacola and Panama City. On the other hand, the Redneck Riviera (which also encompasses the Gulf Coast of Alabama) is the title of a country song by Tom T. Hall that includes the lyric ''Nobody cares if gramma's got a tattoo.'' My childhood was firmly rooted in the latter. We stayed in a motel called the Frangista Beach by an R.V. park whose denizens caught rays atop their Winnebagos and made hatbands out of Budweiser pop tops, which were in ample supply. When we weren't eating peanut butter and jelly or the crabs we caught ourselves at night, we dined in such ''nice'' restaurants as Captain Anderson's and the Sandflea, where the specialties were deep-fried shellfish and stuffed flounder. My parents bought whiskey at the Green Knight, which featured a giant green knight out front, and took us, on rainy days, to the Gulfarium in Fort Walton Beach.", "subsection_name": null, "snippet": "These days, the area known as the Redneck Riviera is a lot more riviera than redneck, especially when it comes to dining...."}, {"blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Travel", "word_count": "10", "headline": {"main": "Haute Cuisine in the Colorado Rockies"}, "multimedia": [{"legacy": {"widewidth": "190", "wideheight": "126", "wide": "images/2008/06/08/travel/0608-CHOICE-B.JPG"}, "url": "images/2008/06/08/travel/0608-CHOICE-B.JPG", "height": 126, "width": 190, "subtype": "wide", "type": "image"}, {"legacy": {"thumbnailheight": "75", "thumbnailwidth": "75", "thumbnail": "images/2008/06/08/travel/0608-CHOICE-S.JPG"}, "url": "images/2008/06/08/travel/0608-CHOICE-S.JPG", "height": 75, "width": 75, "subtype": "thumbnail", "type": "image"}], "byline": null, "document_type": "multimedia", "print_page": null, "slideshow_credits": null, "keywords": [{"value": "Travel and Vacations", "is_major": "N", "rank": "1", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Aspen (Colo)", "is_major": "N", "rank": "2", "name": "glocations"}, {"value": "Organic Food", "is_major": "N", "rank": "3", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Restaurants", "is_major": "N", "rank": "4", "name": "subject"}], "pub_date": "2008-06-08T23:15:01Z", "_id": "504a8a0b1c22dfde670c2f79", "type_of_material": "Slideshow", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2008/06/08/travel/0608-CHOICE_index.html", "news_desk": "Travel", "abstract": null, "lead_paragraph": "Organic farming in Aspen is changing ideas about dining out.
