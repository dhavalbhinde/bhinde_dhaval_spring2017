This turn-of-the-century Basque village of 175,000 inhabitants is built around an enchanting scallop-shaped bay, protected by mountains from the ravages of the Atlantic. Expansive sandy beaches, a fishing port, wide promenades and an exuberant old town of cobbled streets lined with lively bars make it an ideal summer destination. It is just a 45-minute drive south of the French Basque towns of Bayonne and Biarritz. Before Europeans began flocking to the Costa del Sol in Spain, they came to San Sebastian -- also known by its Basque name, Donostia -- made fashionable by wealthy Spaniards in the 1880's. Most of the buildings date from the late 19th century, for this ancient site has burned to the ground more than a dozen times.", "subsection_name": null, "snippet": "SAN Sebastian is a small, elegant seaside resort that feels frozen in time.
