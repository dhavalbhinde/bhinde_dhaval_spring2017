True, residents are justly proud of their world-class barbecue joints and steakhouses, and many a meal involves mashed potatoes, biscuits and gravy. But possibilities extend into more sophisticated realms. The already lively dining scene in this prosperous metropolis has been energized by the brand-new Lidia's, an ambitious restaurant with roots in New York and Trieste. Storefront ethnic restaurants are popping up everywhere, but what's most notable is how well the new American style of cooking stands up to more famous American restaurants on either coast. Kansas City chefs defer to no one in refining local styles while seeking out the best regional farm products as well as ingredients flown in from around the world.
