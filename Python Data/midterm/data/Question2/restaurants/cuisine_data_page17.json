You might say he has the sea in his blood. He was born in Le Havre, one of France's major seaports. His father and both his grandfathers were sailors, and he first went to sea in 1955 on the Liberte when he was 15 years old. Today, as the owner of La Petite Marmite restaurant on Mitchell Place in Manhattan, his sailing is strictly recreational, on a 30-foot Pearson that he docks at Young's Boatyard in Port of Egypt, near Greenport. Naturally, he dines very well on board. ''I do not want to be bothered with elaborate cooking on the weekends,'' he said, ''but I insist on good food.'' The hardships of a cramped, minimally equipped galley, limited storage space or rolling seas do not diminish the meals served on board the Clavier. The solution to these problems, according to Mr. Ruette, is to plan carefully, spend a little extra time during the week preparing food or shopping for ingredients that can be brought from home, and take advantage of the fresh local seafood and produce.", "subsection_name": null, "snippet": "JACKY RUETTE was a sailor long before he was a restaurateur.
