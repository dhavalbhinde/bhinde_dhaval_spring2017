Sometimes the Frito-Lay trucks seem to outnumber the library patrons' cars in the parking lot, but leasing space has been advantageous to the library district. The monthly rent helps pay the mortgage, Mr. Cicola said. ''I think we're unique,'' he added. ''Most libraries start out by renting store space. Before they buy a building they're the tenants.
